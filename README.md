# Interview Scheduler

Welcome to Interview Scheduler! A fictitious appointment booking platform where students at a fake school can pick from a roster of fake interviewers and book an appointment. 

This React App is an educational project as part of the curriculum for Lighthouse Labs full-stack web development diploma program. 

Interviewers' schedules are managed and populated during their given availability, and students may peruse the days of the week to see what openings exist and book an appointment of their own. They may also edit existing appointments (like a fascist wiki-appointment system, where the last one to edit the spot gets it!), or delete them as necessary, with each function updating a scheduling database and managing the app state to reflect the current appointment availability status. 

The app is a demonstration of React application architecture, and an exercise in props passing and drilling, react app testing, and an introduction to Cypress E2E testing. It does not allow students to make accounts and protect their appointments with credential requirements for future edits. It does demonstrate how state values can be passed through various components to conditionally render many different visual representations. CSS credit goes to the project authors. It is a very pretty application.
